<h2 id='ch_I' title="A Girl, a Dog, and a Man.">
  <span>CHAPTER I</span><br/>A GIRL, A DOG, AND A MAN.
</h2>

<p>When Miss Elizabeth Wiggin settled herself comfortably in the shade of the
spreading oak in Libby’s pasture, she looked forward eagerly to a pleasant and
quiet hour with her book, “Wooed, Won, and Wedded.” As may be surmised from the
title of the book, Miss Wiggin was romantic. She was likewise just eighteen
years of age, and the daughter of Judge Nathan P. Wiggin, of Greenbush, the
village that could be seen nestling in the valley something like a mile distant
from that hillside oak.</p>

<p>Miss Wiggin lived in Greenbush, but on pleasant afternoons she had a habit of
wandering away, accompanied only by an aged shepherd dog, in search of some spot
where she could read without fear of interruption. For her grim old father
objected to trashy love stories, and her ascetic spinster aunt, who had acted as
the judge’s housekeeper since the death of Mrs. Wiggin, held all such fiction in
abhorrence.</p>

<p>Indeed, the animus of Aunt Sally Wiggin against stories depicting the ravages
wrought by the little god of the bow and arrow was so extreme that, by
consigning such terrible tales to the flames whenever she found them about the
house, she conscientiously did her best to prevent them from turning the head of
her niece. She even forbade the village news dealer to sell Bessie any more
books of that type.</p>

<p>In these days, however, it is no easy matter to deprive any one of the mental
pabulum that is desired, and Aunt Sally had set herself a task that she could
not accomplish. Lemuel Dodd, Judge Wiggin’s hostler and man of all work,
red-headed, freckled, and homely as a slump fence, undeterred by the
discouraging fact that his persistent efforts to make love to Bessie seemed
merely to arouse her amusement, became her secret and faithful ally. Twice a
week, at least, he spent twenty-five cents of his wages for a paper-covered
novel to be smuggled into her possession, and invariably he chose the ones whose
titles seemed to promise that their contents would come up to Elizabeth’s
requirements.</p>

<p>“There ain’t many single fellers left round this town,” Lemuel told himself,
“and mebbe if she reads enough of them yarns she’ll git so desprit she’ll have
to grab what’s handy. And when she gits the notion to grab, I’m going to take
keer that I’m the handiest thing in reach.”</p>

<p>And so, on this sunny September afternoon, Bessie Wiggin was seeking the
shade of the oak in Libby’s pasture, presumably afar from interruption, and
prepared thoroughly to enjoy Lemuel’s latest contribution. Her face was almost
hidden by one of Aunt Sally’s extremely old-fashioned sunbonnets, which she had
hastily taken when she slipped out of the house with the book. Shep, the old
dog, stretched himself in the short grass at her feet and prepared to go to
sleep comfortably.</p>

<p>The view from this spot, at a considerable distance from the brown road that
wound, ribbonlike, down into the village, was pleasant to the eye, but the
judge’s daughter lost no time in admiring the scenery. She was soon absorbed in
the pages of her novel.</p>

<p>So absorbed did she become that she failed to hear the approaching steps of a
somewhat dusty and soiled, but decidedly good-looking, young man in a brown
Norfolk suit, knee-length leather leggings, and a motoring cap. He was within a
few yards of her when he saw her and stopped.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, madam,” he said, looking down upon the obscuring
sunbonnet.</p>

<p>She uttered a little startled scream, and looked up, her blue eyes wide, her
red lips parted. A glimpse of the pretty and youthful face which the sunbonnet
had concealed caused the stranger to catch his breath.</p>

<p>“Reginald!” exclaimed Miss Wiggin, beholding before her the living
incarnation of the hero of her book just as her fancy had pictured him.</p>

<p>“Daphne!” said the young man, thinking of the mythological wood nymph.</p>

<p>“Woof!” barked the old dog, awaking and springing up as quickly as age and
rheumatism would allow.</p>

<p>The stranger backed round to the opposite side of the tree. “Keep that beast
away from me, please,” he begged, in evident apprehension.</p>

<p>With a swift sweep of one slender hand, Miss Wiggin thrust back the
sunbonnet, which, held by the loosely knotted ribbons, hung suspended on her
shoulders, exposing a mass of wavy, golden-brown hair. At the same moment, with
remarkable agility and grace, she half rose and half turned. On her knees, her
right hand clasping the book, the fingers of her left hand lightly touching the
ground, her gaze followed the shrinking young man, who was now fearfully
watching the ominously growling dog. Surely this was unexpected and
disappointing behavior for Reginald, the brave, who&mdash;in her novel&mdash;had
unhesitatingly faced the most frightful perils for his lady fair.</p>

<p>Made suspicious by the actions of the stranger, Shep advanced, bristling and
snapping. As if contemplating instant flight, the young man gave one hasty look
around. The nearest fence was some six or eight rods away, and it did not
promise to stop a ferocious and angry dog in pursuit of a fleeing fugitive, and
there was no other refuge in sight.</p>

<p>“Keep that creature away, won’t you?” again entreated the agitated man,
placing the trunk of the tree between himself and the animal. “I detest
dogs!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reginald!” sighed Bessie Wiggin in bitter disappointment!</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it!” exploded the stranger, with shocking violence. “If I had a
gun&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Shep charged, barking violently. He meant to stop out of reach of the man’s
feet in case he showed a disposition to kick. But, making a great leap, the
stranger clutched a stout lower limb of the tree, and swung himself up out of
the reach of harm with the most amazing celerity, the dog snapping at his heels
as they receded skyward.</p>

<p>Perched astride the limb, with his feet drawn up, the refugee shook his fist
at the raging animal, which, inflamed by success, made another great jump into
the air and fell back on the ground, his age-enfeebled legs collapsing beneath
him.</p>

<p>Still kneeling, the girl burst into a peal of laughter.</p> </div>

  <span>CHAPTER II</span><br/>ROMANCE JUSTIFIED.
</h2>

<p>“Go to it!” said the exasperated man in the tree. “Get in your laugh while
the laughing’s good. If your confounded dog had succeeded in chewing some chunks
out of me, I suppose you’d simply have collapsed with merriment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” gasped Miss Wiggin, trying to suppress her mirth. “If you only
realized how ridiculous it is! Old Shep couldn’t hurt a sick kitten.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted the stranger skeptically. “Perhaps not, but he certainly
showed a strong desire to plant a few teeth in any part of my person that he
could reach.”</p>

<p>Miss Wiggin continued to laugh. “It would have to be a <i>few</i> teeth, as
he’s lost almost all that he ever had, and he’s so old that he’s half deaf and
getting blind. That’s why he didn’t warn me that you were coming. If you hadn’t
shown that you were scared, he’d never have made an offer to touch you.”</p>

<p>“How was I to know that?” demanded the man on the limb, flushing. “On such
short notice I couldn’t tell whether he was a senile and harmless old dog or a
young and savage one bent on making a meal off my person.”</p>

<p>“You’re an awful coward, aren’t you?” asked the girl, rising to her feet and
regarding him with open contempt.</p>

<p>She was slender, willowy, and graceful. He considered that she was the
prettiest girl he had ever seen, and he wondered how, even with the sunbonnet
hiding her face, he had made the blunder of mistaking her for a middle-aged
woman. He felt his heart thumping queerly. He also felt his face burning beneath
her unmasked disdain.</p>

<p>“Let me explain,” he pleaded hastily.</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary,” she cut him short. “I don’t suppose there are any
Reginalds to be found outside the pages of fiction.”</p>

<p>“The Daphnes,” he returned, “are myths.”</p>

<p>She tossed her head. “Besides being a ’fraid cat,” she retorted, “you’re just
about the most impolite person I ever met. What were you doing prowling around
in this field, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Being in haste to secure a conveyance to Albion for two gentlemen whose
motor has broken down back yonder on the road, I was making a short cut to town
and avoiding the most of the hill. The gentlemen must catch the three-forty
train at Albion. It is now,” he stated, balancing himself on the limb and taking
out his watch, “seven minutes past two.”</p>

<p>“And twenty-three miles to Albion. Your gentlemen will have to hurry.”</p>

<p>“They may make it if I can get an automobile in town.”</p>

<p>Again she laughed. “Automobiles aren’t popular in Greenbush. Peter Beedy is
the only citizen who owns one. He’s been arrested and fined four times for
exceeding the speed limit of eight miles an hour. The last time that happened he
was so mad he swore he’d never start the machine again, and he had it towed to
his barn and stored away.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the information. Me for Peter Beedy.” He glanced downward.
Sitting on his haunches and gazing upward with a wistful eye, Shep was licking
his old chops. “If you will be good enough to call your dog away and keep a
firm, restraining hand upon him, I’ll hit the high spots between here and Mr.
Beedy’s domicile.”</p>

<p>“As long as you’re so completely lacking in sand,” said she, “I’ll collar
Shep and hold him until you get a fair start. But let me warn you that if you
succeed in getting Beedy’s auto you’ll certainly be pinched and fined if you’re
caught driving faster than eight miles an hour anywhere within the town
limits.”</p>

<p>“It’s always necessary,” was his retort, “first to catch your hare. If
Beedy’s bubble has any speed at all, somebody will be handed a laugh. When you
give the word, I’ll come down.”</p>

<p>Now it chanced that neither of them had noticed the approach of Libby’s bull,
confined in that same pasture. The bull was ugly, and resentful of intrusion on
its domain. And just as the girl placed one hand on the dog’s collar the bull
charged, with a snort and a bellow. The man on the limb shouted a warning. The
girl screamed and dodged behind the tree. The dog, seeing the charging beast by
accident, bounded lamely to meet him. And the bull, with one sweep of his horns,
tossed the dog fifteen feet into the air.</p>

<p>The man in the tree was paralyzed with horror. The disastrous attempt of the
dog to protect his mistress seemed to check the charging bull for barely a
fraction of a second. With glaring eyes, the beast came on, dashing straight at
the terrified girl.</p>

<p>“The fence!” shouted the man. “Run!”</p>

<p>Even as he uttered the words he realized what would happen if she attempted
to obey. The infuriated beast would overtake her, toss her with its horns even
as the old dog had been tossed, gore her, trample the life out of her delicate
body. For the briefest fraction of time, he was sickened by the thought. Then he
dropped from the tree directly in the path of the mad creature. As he dropped,
he snatched the cap from his head. The instant his toes touched the turf, he
sprang to one side. The bull missed him by a foot, and he struck the animal
across the eyes with his cap.</p>

<p>It seemed like a feeble thing to do, but he had time for nothing else, and he
hoped desperately to turn the attention of the beast from the girl; hoped
somehow, by diverting the creature’s fury to himself, to give her an opportunity
to flee to safety beyond the fence.</p>

<p>The girl had circled round the tree, keeping it between herself and the bull.
As the man struck the animal, the latter swerved and turned with amazing speed,
surprised, perhaps, by the appearance of a second human being on the scene. The
stranger waved his arms and shouted challengingly. The animal accepted the
challenge promptly and charged at him.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Miss Wiggin. “He’ll be&mdash;killed!”</p>

<p>But, almost with the agility of a capeador, the young man again leaped aside
at precisely the right moment to foil the beast. Again he struck with his cap,
but this time it was impaled on one of the bull’s horns and torn from his
hand.</p>

<p>Without glancing round at the girl, he cried sharply, commandingly: “Run for
the fence! I’ll keep him busy till you are safe.”</p>

<p>Bessie Wiggin ran, just as she was ordered to do, although she did not
realize what she was doing until she had almost reached the fence. Too terrified
to look back, she actually sailed over the barrier almost as a frightened deer
might have done, scarcely touching the top rail, falling safe on the far side
amid some bowlders and bushes, where for a moment she lay panting and
helpless.</p>

<p>She was aroused by Shep. The faithful old dog had not been killed. Limping
and whining, he had followed her in her flight and dragged himself through the
fence. Still whining plaintively, he was licking her face.</p>

<p>With a sobbing cry, she seized the fence and pulled herself to her feet.
Still baiting the bull, the young man was dodging round and round the tree, the
enraged beast making every effort to reach him. He had kept his word; he had
held the attention of the animal while she escaped; the handsome stranger she
had called a coward had taken this dreadful risk for her.</p>

<p>Realizing the danger he was in, she called to him wildly: “Oh, look
out&mdash;look out! Jump&mdash;quick! Run! Do something!”</p>

<p>He certainly was doing something; in fact, he was an extremely busy person
just then. Again and again he appeared to avoid the rushes of the bull barely by
a hair’s breadth. Each time this happened the girl’s heart seemed ready to burst
with terror. It could not last long. The snorting, bellowing beast would get him
at last. A slight miscalculation, the slightest slip, and it would all be
over.</p>

<p>Bessie Wiggin grasped a stake of the fence, and tried desperately to tear it
loose, intending to return to the assistance of the stranger with this weapon.
She was the coward, after all! She had run away and left him to be killed!</p>

<p>Then she saw him “put over” a bit of strategy on the bull. The animal had
paused for a moment, and turned slowly upon him, pawing the ground. Instead of
placing the tree between himself and danger, the man planted his back against
it, his eyes never leaving the beast for an instant.</p>

<p>Waving his hands in gestures of disdain, he taunted the creature. “Come on,
old lumberheels! Wake up and show a little pep! Throw into high gear and give us
some speed. Don’t quit now; the fun’s just begun. Wake up! Come on!”</p>

<p>The bull leaped forward like a hurricane. And just as the pale and horrified
girl expected to see the man impaled to the tree, he slipped deftly behind it.
The head of the bull crashed against the oak, and the animal staggered as if
struck by a butcher’s maul.</p>

<p>The stranger laughed. “That ought to give you a slight headache,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Run!” cried the girl. “This way&mdash;quick! Now’s the time!”</p>

<p>Dazed, the bull was backing off slowly, shaking his head. Evidently the man
agreed with Bessie that the moment was propitious, for he turned and raced
toward the fence. But the animal had not been injured nearly as much as one
might have supposed, and, seeing his mocking foe in flight, he plunged in
pursuit.</p>

<p>The stranger was fleet-footed, but the bull was a trifle fleeter. Just as the
runner gathered himself to take the fence with one clean leap, the beast
overtook him. Through the air sailed the man, propelled by the head and horns of
the bull, as well as by the spring of his own legs. Over the fence in a great
curve he came, crashing head downward amid the rocks and bushes.</p>

<p>When the young man opened his eyes again, he discovered that his head was
resting in the lap of Miss Bessie Wiggin, who, sobbing hysterically, was wiping
his forehead with a bloodstained handkerchief.</p>

<p>He looked up at her and smiled. “Daphne!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Reginald!” she cried.</p>

</h2>

<p>“You’re not killed, are you?” she sobbed, trying to stanch the flow of blood
that trickled from a gash at the edge of his hair near his temple.</p>

<p>“If I am,” he returned, with a feeble effort to jest, “I don’t know it
yet.”</p>

<p>“But you’re hurt. You struck on your head.”</p>

<p>“Probably that saved my life. Solid ivory, you know. I will admit that I feel
a trifle upset, so to speak. No, don’t move&mdash;please don’t! The mere thought
of your moving gives me pain.”</p>

<p>“But I must go for help. You’re wounded.”</p>

<p>“I am,” he admitted, gazing up into her blue eyes in a manner that gave her a
most peculiar sensation. “Mortally wounded. I fear. I never was hit so hard in
my life, and I am afraid I can’t recover.”</p>

<p>Again she cried out in apprehension and distress. “Oh, I was afraid you were
done for when that beast caught you!”</p>

<p>“I am,” was his singularly cheerful acknowledgment; “I’m done for. I’ve got
mine. The jig is up with me.”</p>

<p>“Is it your arms, your legs? Your ribs&mdash;are they smashed? Where do you
feel it most?”</p>

<p>“Here,” he answered, putting his hand to his heart. “Rut it isn’t my ribs;
it’s something deeper, Daphne.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t my name; it’s Bessie.”</p>

<p>“Bessie! Mine’s George. Awfully commonplace, isn’t it? Now, if my folks had
only called me Reginald&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t try to talk. I’m sure it’s painful. You must keep still.”</p>

<p>“I will if you’ll keep on talking yourself. The sound of your voice soothes
me like the murmuring of a brook. Your eyes are like springtime violets. The
touch of your little hand is as delicious as a draft of pure water to a person
dying of thirst. Now I’ll leave it to you if a Reginald could beat that speech
much.”</p>

<p>She stiffened and drew back a bit, the color beginning to return to her pale
cheeks. They looked at each other steadily, and the returning flush covered her
face.</p>

<p>Beyond the fence the victorious bull pawed the ground; from a vantage of
safety the old dog glared through the rails and regarded the bull with
disapproval, but the man and girl paid no attention to either of them. The girl
had turned her gaze toward the distant road that wound down into the
village.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you are hurt much,” she said, in a low voice, which,
however, was made unsteady by a queer little throbbing in her throat. “If you
were, you couldn’t talk like that.”</p>

<p>“It’s because I am that I can talk like that,” he declared. “It’s the first
time I ever talked that way to any one.”</p>

<p>“Your friends who have to get to Albion,” she murmured; “I’m afraid they’ll
lose their train.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he cried, sitting up suddenly. “I’d clean forgotten them!”</p>

<p>“You were fooling me!” she exclaimed, as she started to rise.</p>

<p>With a groan he fell back. The crimson, oozing from his wound, ran down
across his temple, and in another moment she was again checking the flow with
her handkerchief. His eyes were closed, and she imagined he had fainted.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” She seemed distraught. “I don’t know what to do! I’ve got to get
help, but if I leave you, you may bleed to death.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let me bleed to death,” he begged faintly. “Don’t leave
me&mdash;Bessie. You mustn’t leave me&mdash;as long as I live.”</p>

<p>It seemed a great effort for him to lift his eyelids, but he looked at her
again, and the appeal in his eyes filled her with a feeling of desperation.</p>

<p>“You must have a doctor.”</p>

<p>“You’re the only doctor I want. You’re the only doctor who can cure me. If
you throw up the case and turn me over to a common pill slinger, I’ll never get
over it.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve simply got to get help for you somehow. I’ll hurry.”</p>

<p>“I can’t let you go. I’m an awful coward, you know, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re nothing of the sort! I’ve never seen anybody as brave as you
are.”</p>

<p>A tremor ran over his body. At first she thought it was a convulsive movement
of pain, but when it continued she was overcome by the astounding conviction
that he was laughing. Astonishment gave place to outraged indignation. There was
no mistaking the fact that he was really shaking with laughter that he sought in
vain to suppress. She leaped up, letting him drop back, and stood rigid, filled
with intense resentment.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you’re making sport of me!” she said, in a low voice that suddenly
had in it something like icy brittleness. “You’ve been playing on my sympathy!
You’re not really hurt&mdash;much. It was a very ungentlemanly thing to do! I
hope you have enjoyed yourself!”</p>

<p>He sat up without much effort. “I give you my word of honor that I didn’t
mean to laugh at you. Perhaps my head is affected a little. This crack on the
bean must be the cause. It really was some bump.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you wretch!” she cried, stamping her foot. “I hate you!”</p>

<p>Her little hands were tightly clenched. She turned away to hide the tears
which welled again into her eyes; but now they were tears of exasperation,
shame, and rage.</p>

<p>He got quickly to his feet. “Please, Bessie!” he said. “You don’t understand.
Not for the world would I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped short, staring across at the road, down which a touring car
containing two men was speeding toward the village.</p>

<p>“Great Caesar!” he cried. “There goes the governor! Hitchens must have got
the engine running somehow. They’ll expect to find me in town.” With all the
strength of a good pair of lungs, he shouted, waving his hands above his head.
The automobile sped on. Its occupants neither saw nor heard him.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m left for the time being,” he said. “They’ll go ripping straight
through to catch that train at Albion.”</p>

<p>“They won’t rip through very far,” Miss Wiggin flung at him. “There’s a trap
just outside the village, watched by a deputy sheriff and two constables. Your
old governor will be nabbed and pulled up before my father, who will soak him
with a fine. And I hope dad soaks him good,” she finished, laughing, and doing
so with a vindictiveness that seemed to afford her untold relief and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Small, constable of the town of Greenbush, sat on the top rail of
the roadside fence and wedged a load of fine cut into the bowl of a burned,
blackened, odorous corncob pipe, packing it down with a decidedly dirty thumb.
From his perch he could look over the top of a cluster of low sumacs and keep
watch upon a point on the hillside where the highway wound into view. He could
also see, somewhat nearer, a tall and lonely elm tree, past which the road ran
in a broadside curve.</p>

<p>“Weeping” Buzzell, another constable, was sitting on the ground in the shade
of the sumacs, leaning against the fence, and occasionally wiping his red-rimmed
and watery eyes with a faded and mussed bandanna handkerchief. His jaws worked
wearily at a quid of tobacco, the presence of which was further advertised by
the unmistakable stains at the corners of his doleful and flabby mouth. He had
chosen his lowly position for comfort, and because his companion was far better
adapted to the task of outlook.</p>

<p>“I tell you, ’Miah,” sniffed Buzzell, “this here job is jest about played
out. A dollar-sixty a day ain’t no livin’ pay for a hard-workin’ man, and that’s
all we git outside commissions on the fines the jedge imposes, and the deputy
sheruff gits the biggest whack at them. We have to be pacified with what comes
outer the little end o’ the horn. Yis-tidday my share was thutty-two cents, and
so fur to-day we ain’t nabbed only one motor-cycle feller who come through by
accident, havin’ got off the road to Damascus. I’m gittin’ discouraged.”</p>

<p>Constable Small made a final poke at the pipe bowl, and glanced down at the
complaining individual. “Never knowed you to tackle any job that you didn’t git
discouraged over in a short time, Silas,” he averred contemptuously. “Gittin’
discouraged is your long suit. You’ve been discouraged all your life.”</p>

<p>Buzzell moved his slouching shoulders resentfully. “Mebbe that’s so, ’Miah,
but I ain’t never had no luck, like some folks. When I was swore in as constable
and put on this job, there was an av’rage of eighteen or twenty merchines a day
that went through town regardless of speed regerlations. Business was lively,
and I sorter guessed my luck had turned. But now them there automobile fellers
has got wise and sent out warnin’s and posted notices in all the garrages round
about cautionin’ folks to keep away from Greenbush, and they’re goin’ round by
the way of Damascus or Cherryfield, and leavin’ us to twiddle our thumbs. My
opinion, it’s hurt the town, too; Greenbush is deader’n a salted herrin’.”</p>

<p>Small lifted a broganed foot and struck a match on the leg of his trousers,
after which he held it up until his wheezing pipe was lit.</p>

<p>“Better not go makin’ that kind of talk in the hearin’ of Jedge Wiggin,” he
warned, pulling hard at the rebellious corncob. “If you done so, he’d tell you
what in a hurry, and you’d lose your badge so quick it’d make your head swim.
You know him, Silas. He ain’t got no use for automobiles nohow, and when he
announced that he perposed to enforce the speed regerlations without fear or
favor, he sartainly meant it. He’d slap a fine onter the President of the United
States if he was to go scootin’ through town faster’n the speed limit
allows.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe he would,” said Buzzell. “He’s so hard-headed and sot it would be just
like him. Jest because he’s alwus been a hoss owner and a hoss-man, he’s down on
automobiles in gen’ral and ev’rybody that has anything to do with ’em. I reckon
that’s <i>why</i>he wants to be representative to the legislator, he wants to go
there to put through some kind of a bill to restrict the use of them merchines
to certain roads so that the drivers of hosses can have the other roads to
themselves. That’s jest how old-fashioned the jedge is.”</p>

<p>“Lemme tell you somethin’, Silas,” said Constable Small, taking his pipe from
between his teeth and striking an impressive attitude with it. “They better let
him go. If the jedge don’t git the nomination from this deestrict, he’ll upset
their apple cart as sure as preachin’. There’ll be three candidates in the
primaries, and the party don’t want Rufe Crockett, for he’s a windbag, a
turncoat, and a flopper, and he’d be beat at the polls, just as he was four year
ago on the ticket of t’other party. But if Jedge Wiggin can’t win, I’ll bet you
a twenty-cent plug of War Hoss he turns his strength ag’inst Ephraim Glover, of
Palmyra, and throws the nomination to Crockett. This deestrict is the keystone,
and if the party loses it, they’ll most likely lose the whole county. I
understand the governor himself is ruther fretted over the situation, with the
primaries comin’ on next week.”</p>

<p>“I don’t keer much about politics nohow,” declared Buzzell, wiping his eyes
again. “One party’s bad as t’other, and there ain’t neither of ’em done nothing
for me. Still I s’pose I’m expected to vote for the jedge jest because I
happened to be the most capable man they could find for this job. Nobody else I
know of wanted it. I took it because it promised to be a purty good thing, not
because I’m partic’ler agin’ automobilists. I’m goin’ to tell you my private
idee: I think Nathan Wiggin’s turned Greenbush into a graveyard by finin’
ev’rybody ketched goin’ faster’n eight miles in the town limits. He’s give the
place a black eye and set people to dodgin’ it. He ain’t progressive, that’s ail
I got to say.”</p>

<p>“And if you’ve got any sense left in your noodle you won’t go round
kow-wowing that kind of talk. If you did&mdash;&mdash; Hey! By gowdy! Here comes
a bubble over the hill! Git up! Git out your ticker and ketch him when he passes
the big elm. He’s hittin’ it up like a streak of greased quicksilver.”</p>

<p>There was immediate action in the shade of the sumacs. With a sniffling
grunt, which held something both of protest and eagerness, Weeping Buzzell
heaved himself to his feet, fishing for his watch. On the fence Jeremiah Small
already had his timepiece in hand. His snaggy teeth gripped the pipestem; his
leathery face expressed the rapacity of the still hunter who has sighted
game.</p>

<p>“Ready, now!” he cried. “Ketch him when I give the word. <i>Now!</i>”</p>

<p>Down the winding road shot the automobile, trailing a cloud of dust behind
it. Besides the driver, a smoothfaced, bespectacled man of thirty, it contained
only one person, a stout, florid, worried-looking individual in the middle years
of life.</p>

<p>“Careful, Hitchens!” warned the latter, as the man at the wheel made a turn
that barely prevented them from taking to the ditch. “You know you’re not used
to driving. Don’t pile us up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, sir,” returned the driver reassuringly. “You know you’ve got to
catch that train if you’re going to get to your office for the conference with
the chairman of the State committee. You’ll have to talk with old Wiggin over
the phone. No time to stop in Greenbush and chin with him now.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to pick up the boy in town. He must have got there twenty minutes
ago. We’re liable to meet him starting out after me with a hired car. Keep your
eyes peeled.”</p>

<p>Around another curve careened the car, and struck the straight, gentle
incline running down into the village. Out from behind the sumacs dashed the
constables, Jeremiah Small planting himself in the very center of the highway,
one hand upflung authoritatively while the other flipped back his coat and
revealed the badge pinned to his left suspender. Silas Buzzell backed him up,
but with a shade more discretion about blocking the path of the speeding motor
car.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted Constable Small. “In the name of the law I command you!”</p>

<p>“Hold up!” wheezed Constable Buzzell. “Stop right where ye be!”</p>

<p>“Pinched!” exclaimed the driver, in disgust and consternation.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop! Go on!” rasped the florid-faced man at his side. Then he lifted
himself above the glass wind shield, flung up his gloved hands, and roared:
“Clear the road, you idiots! Out of the way! Get out!”</p>

<p>Seeing the automobile whizzing straight at him without slackening speed to
any perceptible degree, Jeremiah Small cast his dignity to the winds and made a
leap for safety. Weeping Buzzell backed off the shoulder of the road, caught his
heel, and sat down amid the dusty grass of the shallow ditch. The car swished
past, the stout man relaxing on the seat, and tore on its way.</p>

<p>“That’ll cost ye ten dollars more for defyin’ the majesty of the law!”
spluttered Small, shutting his eyes to prevent them from being filled with the
blinding cloud of dust flung over both officers. “The jedge alwus tucks on an
additional ten for that trick. Go it, you gay birds! The faster you drive, the
higher you’ll bounce when you hit the bumps. Come on, Silas! Deputy Newberry’ll
have that gay pair collared in two shakes of a lamb’s tail.”</p>

<p>If the defiant autoists fancied they were to escape the clutches of the speed
regulators in that easy manner, they soon realized their error. Farther on
toward the village, running the full width of the road, were a series of
artfully arranged ridges and hollows calculated to give a severe shaking up to
the passengers of any motor car proceeding at a speed exceeding four or five
miles an hour.</p>

<p>When this particular car struck those speed-killers, the two occupants were
shot into the air with great violence. Coming down, the car seemed to meet them
coming up, and the second and third bounces were worse than the first. Indeed,
it was little short of remarkable that the florid-faced passenger succeeded in
staying in the car at all. The driver, clinging desperately to the wheel, had a
better chance, although he found it extremely difficult. And ahead of them the
road undulated for a distance of several rods, like miniature waves of the
sea.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Woogh! Woosh!” spluttered the older man, clutching wildly at the
bucking car. “What&mdash;in&mdash;Halifax! Shut her&mdash;unk!&mdash;down,
Hitchens! Stop her!”</p>

<p>Hitchens struggled to obey, finally succeeding in throwing the clutch and
jamming on the brake. The wheels, locked, slid with a grinding sound that meant
money in the pocket of some tire manufacturer, the car bobbed and hobbled over
the ragged places, and the pursuing cloud of dust swooped down over them. When
the dust settled a little and they could catch their breath again, they beheld a
formidable, satisfied-looking man calmly mounting the right-hand running
board.</p>

<p>“I’m the deputy sheruff of this town,” announced the individual who had
boarded them. “And you are took up for breaking the speed limit and defyin’ two
regler authorized officers of the law.”</p>

  <span>CHAPTER V</span><br/>DISPENSING JUSTICE.
</h2>

<p>The driver bristled with indignation.</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage!” he cried. “We must get to Albion in time to catch the
three-forty train. You can’t stop us.”</p>

<p>“I’ve stopped ye already,” said Deputy Sheriff Newberry serenely. “Under the
circumstances it don’t become you to tell me what I can’t do. You’ll be
permitted to proceed on your way to Albion after Jedge Wiggin attends to your
case. So you might as well soople down and take it calm.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand, you don’t know who you’re holding up in this
high-handed fashion. You are interfering with&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait, Hitchens!” cut in the other man, giving a glance at his watch. “Never
mind telling him who we are.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t necessary,” stated Newberry. “You’ll have to tell the jedge,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“How long,” asked the man with the watch, “will it require to get through
with this business so that we may go on. It is most important that we should get
that train.”</p>

<p>“Wull,” drawled the deputy, “if the jedge is around handy, and he don’t read
you too long a lecture before he slaps on the fine, mebbe you’ll git started
ag’in in half or three-quarters of an hour; ’tain’t likely to be more’n an hour,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Half an hour will make us miss the train. Can’t we fix it with you?”</p>

<p>“Now take keer, take keer! Don’t you go for to offer no bribes to an officer
of the law. I couldn’t take them nohow,” he added as Constable Small came
hurrying up with Constable Buzzell wheezing and sniffling at his heels.</p>

<p>“But,” protested Hitchens, “if you knew who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” interrupted the older man sharply. “The other business
will have to wait. I have a curiosity to see just how Judge Wiggin handles cases
of this sort.”</p>

<p>“Your cur’osity,” assured Deputy Sheriff Newberry, swinging open the tonneau
door, “will be satisfied. Git in, boys!”</p>

<p>When the three men had all piled into the rear of the car the one in command
directed Hitchens to drive straight down the long main street of the town, and
proceeded slowly.</p>

<p>Their appearance in the village was the signal for various inhabitants who
observed them to grin and wag their heads, making uncomplimentary and derisive
remarks, while a number of small boys, hooting and laughing, assembled and
followed the car as far as Turner’s grocery, over which, in a bare and sparsely
furnished room, Judge Wiggin dispensed justice by mulcting the unfortunate
speeders who were arraigned before him. A number of idle citizens, who had been
gossiping and swapping stories on the store steps, rose at once and followed the
prisoners, conducted by Newberry and Buzzell, up the narrow back stairs to the
“courtroom.” Jeremiah Small had been sent to fetch the judge.</p>

<p>The automobilists were given chairs facing a table which served as a desk,
and an anæmic-looking young man in horn-rimmed spectacles seated himself at the
table and began making out the complaint, having first questioned Buzzell about
the speed which the offenders had been making when they ran into the trap.</p>

<p>“Your name?” inquired the clerk, turning to the older man.</p>

<p>“Put down John Doe,” said the latter, “and Richard Roe,” he added, nodding
toward his companion. “I am the owner of the car. Richard was driving when we
were held up.”</p>

<p>The younger man gave him a queer look, and leaned closer, whispering
something behind his hand. The answer was a grim smile and a shake of the head.
After slight hesitation, the clerk wrote down the names as given.</p>

<p>The sound of heavy steps on the stairs preceded the entrance of Constable
Small, who announced that the judge was out somewhere, but that Willie Baker and
Nubby Snell had been sent scouting to find him.</p>

<p>“I never heard of such an outrage!” exploded the intensely annoyed Hitchens.
“Somebody is going to regret this imposition. Time is valuable to us,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t git flustered and fly off the handle, mister,” advised Deputy
Newberry, twisting off a quid of War Horse with his teeth and stowing it,
bulging, into his cheek with a tongue made dexterous by long practice. “It won’t
joggle things along no faster, and I ca’late you’ll be the one to do the
regrettin’ if you go shootin’ off a lot of loose talk. If you git sassy before
the jedge, I warn ye now that it’ll prob’ly land ye in the caboose. ‘Go slow’ is
a motter it’s best to toiler around here.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell them something?” persisted Hitchens, again appealing to
his companion.</p>

<p>“What talking I decide to do will be done to the judge himself,” said the
older man.</p>

<p>In the course of fifteen minutes Judge Wiggin appeared. He was a lean and
wiry man with a somewhat grim jaw and a steely blue eye. There was dignity in
his manner. He scarcely glanced at the prisoners as he seated himself at the
table opposite the clerk and adjusted his spectacles to read the complaint.</p>

<p>“Hats off!” he ordered, rapping with his knuckles. “John Doe and Richard Roe,
by the complaint of a deputy sheriff and two constables, by the town of
Greenbush duly and legally authorized, you are hereby charged with catawamping a
hossless vehicle over a public highway, lying within the town limits, at a speed
of forty miles an hour, thereby rupturing the law made and provided, and
wantonly and willfully endangering the peace and safety of other persons who
might find it necessary to locomote upon said highway.</p>

<p>“According to the complaint,” the judge continued, “the before-mentioned
Richard Roe was the driver, and the before-mentioned John Doe the owner, of said
hossless vehicle at the time of the infraction of said law. That being the fact,
the penalty administered, in case the charge is admitted or proven, will be
applied in full to the person who was engaged in piloting the juggernaut when
you was nabbed. And let me add that in this court, with the exception of the
judge presiding, unnecessary talk is a luxury, and luxuries add to the high cost
of living. A word to the wise is a seed sown upon good ground that springeth up
and beareth the fruit of economy. Richard Roe, guilty or not guilty?”</p>

<p>Biting his lip with annoyance, the younger of the two prisoners started to
protest: “It was necessary&mdash;er&mdash;your honor, that we should catch the
westward-bound train at Albion. If you were aware who we are, who your petty
officers, hiding like highwaymen in ambush, had ventured to hold
up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again Judge Wiggin’s knuckles smote the desk. “Apparently,” he said, “my
observation regarding the expense of unnecessary talk in this court failed to
sink in, or even to make a dent. No excuse of private necessity condones
infractions of the law. Your careless remark, as well as the suspicious nature
of the names you have given, leads me to believe that you are pirooting around
the country under false colors, and makes it rather probable that you are old
offenders trying in that way to dodge the extreme penalty the court might see
fit to administer if your real identities was known. I shall bear this in mind
in passing sentence.”</p>

<p>The grinning spectators tittered guardedly. The older man reached out and
placed a hand on his companion’s knee.</p>

<p>“You can see that you are simply making matters worse,” he whispered.
“Anything you may say will be used against us. Plead guilty at once.”</p>

<p>Squirming and rebellions, Hitchens complied. However, instead of passing
sentence without delay, the judge squared away on his chair, locked the fingers
of his hands before him, and proceeded to read the culprits a lengthy lecture
anent the rights of the common people upon the highways and the outrageous and
criminal manner in which these rights were disregarded by automobilists in
general.</p>

<p>During this scathing harangue he scarcely looked at either of the impatient
and suffering victims, but kept his gaze fixed, for the most part, on the
rafters above their heads. He was the possessor of a fluent flow of language,
and a somewhat homely native wit that was keen and stinging; and certain it was
that his vituperation was in no degree delicately barbed. Even the
self-restraint of the elder man was tested to the limit.</p>

<p>And presently, when the fine of twenty-five dollars and
costs&mdash;twenty-eight dollars and thirty cents, all told&mdash;had been
inflicted and paid over, the owner of the motor car released the safety
valve.</p>

<p>“Judge Wiggin,” he said, “I’m compelled to tell you that it has never been my
misfortune to witness a greater farce or a more ridiculous travesty of justice.
You made it absolutely evident that, from the very beginning, your mind was made
up and that you would impose a fine, regardless of extenuating circumstances.
You practically warned us that any attempt at defense would merely increase the
sum of money you were determined to get out of us. Such narrow-minded bigotry
stamps you as a man unfit to represent this district in the legislature.”</p>

<p>Nathan Wiggin bent a grim and steady eye upon him. “And them few remarks,” he
returned placidly, “constitute a clear case of contempt, for which I shall have
to tuck on another twenty-five dollars, to preserve the dignity of the court.
However, considering the fact that the last time I heard you speak from the
stump you shot off a whole lot of balderdash, for all of which the so-called
intelligent voters of this State saw fit to elect you governor, I’ll remit the
fine. And discretion being the better part of valor, let me suggest that you
bottle up further seething criticism until we both get outside, where, as man to
man, we can tell each other jest what we think, without mincin’ words.”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 id='ch_VI' title="A Demonstration Postponed.">
  <span>CHAPTER VI</span><br/>A DEMONSTRATION POSTPONED.
</h2>

<p>A bombshell, exploding in that room, could hardly have created a greater
sensation. The governor! The governor of the State, arrested for speeding in the
little town of Greenbush, had been fined by Judge Wiggin, who, as a would-be
candidate for the legislature, required the support and votes in his district of
the governor’s own party!</p>

<p>Further than that, more extraordinary, more incomprehensible, having
immediately recognized the governor as one of the two offenders, the judge had
dared to reprimand him precisely as if he were an ordinary citizen; possibly
with a trifle more caustic severity. And Nat Wiggin was altogether too shrewd
and long-headed not to realize that a single word from the chief executive of
the State would be almost certain to blast his political ambitions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a little calm thought would have led Wiggin’s neighbors there
assembled to realize that his fearless action was precisely what they might have
expected of him. Never in his life had he played the toady, and he was not a
person to cringe in the presence of power and pomp. “Without fear or favor” was
his motto, and, right or wrong, he adhered to it. Hard-headed and obstinate he
might be, but he was not inconsistent.</p>

<p>The spectators crowded forward on tiptoe, gaping, almost aghast. Frowning and
grim, his face purple with anger, the governor stared at the judge. Calm and
unperturbed as a June morning, the latter announced that court was adjourned,
and rose from his seat. Trembling with deepest indignation, the governor’s
secretary pulled at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Come,” urged Hitchens in a low tone, “let’s get out before I lose control of
myself and twist that old lunatic’s nose.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’d better try that, here or elsewhere, under any
provocation,” returned the chief executive. “I’ve a notion he’d take as much
pleasure in fighting as in fining a speeder.”</p>

<p>They turned toward the stairs, the spectators, still staring wide-eyed,
clattering back to open a lane through which they could pass. Weeping Buzzell
was ahead of them, galvanized into unusual and amazing activity.</p>

<p>“Make way for the governor!” he snuffled, waving his arms.</p>

<p>Down the stairs in advance he stumped, bursting with eagerness to carry the
news to those apathetic townsmen who had not been drawn by curiosity to the
courtroom. Marvelous and incredible was the swiftness with which that news
spread. Small boys carried it, scurrying. The governor had been nabbed for
breaking the speed limit; Judge Wiggin had reprimanded and fined him. Villagers
of both sexes and all ages came hurrying toward Turner’s store, anxious to get a
glimpse of the notable who had met such summary and impartial treatment at the
hands of the “jedge.” Hitchens saw them assembling.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this hole,” he urged. “All the jays in the town will be
here in less than ten minutes.” He made for the automobile, which stood in front
of the store, headed down the street.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to find George,” said the governor, following. “It’s odd he hasn’t
shown up. Wonder what’s become of him.”</p>

<p>As they paused irresolutely beside the motor car the judge, having issued
forth, approached. There was nothing placating or apologetic in his manner, nor
did he wear an offensive, defiant air.</p>

<p>“Governor,” he said, “if you’d seen fit to notify me by telefone that
business of importance made it necessary for you to go skihooting through this
town, I’d have had the speed limit raised to fifty miles an hour for the
occasion, and the officers keepin’ an open and clear road for ye. But when you
was ketched, and hauled up before me, same as any other private person, and give
a fictitious name, I figgered there was only one way to handle the case, which
was the same as I’d handle any other. I’m agin’ these here highway locomotives
on principle, and I’d fine the Czar of Roosia if he was took up for speeding in
one within the limits of this town.”</p>

<p>Something like a faint smile began to play around the corners of the
governor’s mouth. “How many times have you ridden in an automobile, Judge
Wiggin?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Jest about as many times as you’ve rid on the tail of a comet, governor. A
good, fast-steppin’ hoss suits me.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And you’ve driven some fast steppers in your time. No doubt you’ve
driven them through the streets of this town at a much greater speed than eight
miles an hour, thus endangering the lives of pedestrians and others upon the
highways.”</p>

<p>“Endangerin’ fiddlesticks! I know how to handle hosses, sir. I’ve broke and
trained hundreds of ’em in my day. I know how to guide ’em and how to stop
’em.”</p>

<p>“Still you may not realize that an expert driver of a motor car has far more
perfect control over his machine than the driver of a spirited horse can
possibly have over the animal. Likewise, an auto moving at the same relative
speed as a horse attached to a carriage may be stopped more quickly than the
horse. Therefore the machine, properly handled, is a smaller menace to human
safety than a horse-drawn carriage.”</p>

<p>“Governor,” said Nathan P. Wiggin, “politeness forbids me to tell you jest
what I think of that statement. Besides, I’ve got my coat on.”</p>

<p>“If you’re too prejudiced,” said the governor, “get into this car with me,
and you shall have a demonstration.” Just how this invitation would have been
received at that moment cannot be said. Through the crowd came a panting,
freckled, red-headed young man, flinging people aside with his long arms.</p>

<p>“Hey, Jedge Wiggin!” he called chokingly. “Bessie’s gone crazy! Come home
quick!”</p>

<p>“Whut’s that, Lem Dodd?” cried the judge, snapping round and grabbing the
young man by the shoulder. “My darter&mdash;gone crazy? What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Jest whut I say,” insisted Lem Dodd chokingly. “She brung a strange young
feller inter the house, and he’s got a crack on his cabeza, and he keeled over
on the parlor sofy, and he looked like he was a goner, with his eyes shet, and
she hollered and flopped on her knees beside him, and called him ‘Reginal’ and
‘dear,’ and called herself a murderer, and kissed him right slap on the kisser.”
He caught his breath with a gulping sound of distress. “And when Miss Sally
asked her who he was, she said she didn’t know, and he don’t b’long round these
parts, for I never see him before, and she’s crazy as a June bug or she’d never
do no such thing.”</p>

<p>“This,” said the judge, “is a case for immejiate investigation. Under the
circumstances, governor, we’ll have to postpone that demonstration till some
future date.”</p>

<p>Then he set off for his home, a short distance up the street, accompanied by
the agitated and urgent Lemuel Dodd.</p>

</div>

<h2 id='ch_VII' title="A Novice at the Wheel.">
  <span>CHAPTER VII</span><br/>A NOVICE AT THE WHEEL.
</h2>

<p>The governor and Hitchens made inquiry of the crowd regarding their missing
driver, but no one present seemed to have seen the man. Presently the governor
turned to his secretary.</p>

<p>“You don’t imagine,” he asked in a low tone, “that the young man who is
injured in Judge Wiggin’s house can be George?”</p>

<p>“The girl called him Reginald, according to that fellow who brought word to
the judge.”</p>

<p>“Still, I’ve got a queer notion that it may be the boy. Let’s investigate.”
When they reached Wiggin’s front door, George, a bandage tied round his head,
was just coming out, followed by the judge, who seemed to be highly disturbed
and indignant.</p>

<p>“I’m all right now, governor,” called the young man reassuringly. “A
disagreeable bull helped me over a fence, and I sort of collapsed after walking
into town.”</p>

<p>“Governor,” said Nathan Wiggin grimly, “as near as I can find out, your
shuffer climbed a tree to git away from a toothless, half-blind old shepherd
dog, and run like the devil when Libby’s bull took after him. Then he follered
my darter home, and walked right into the house arter her. Whuther or not he was
shammin’ when he flopped on the sofy with his eyes shet, Bessie was upsot and
made a touse over him. She’s a ruther emotional girl. My sister’s lookin’ after
her now, and I’ve told her what I think of shuffers in gen’ral and young men
that climb trees to get away from dogs without teeth enough to dent a
biscuit.”</p>

<p>The governor laughed. “There may be an excuse for the young man,” he said.
“He was bitten by a vicious dog when very young, but I don’t think bulls could
scare him much.” He put his arm across the shoulders of the young man. “Are you
sure you’re not hurt much, George?”</p>

<p>“Well, not on the head,” was the reply. “But that girl came pretty near
finishing me. She’s a perfect witch, and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Such a statement concerning my darter is slanderous, considering the fuss
she made over him,” said Judge Wiggin in deep resentment. “But I don’t s’pose
it’s anything more than could be expected of an ordinary shuffer.”</p>

<p>Again the governor laughed in a peculiar way. “Perhaps not,” he admitted,
turning back to the judge. “I’d like to convince you, however, that my argument
about automobiles was right, and, as long as you prevented me from catching my
train after I had spent three hours persuading Ephraim Glover, of Palmyra, to
withdraw and not contest you in the primaries, I think it is up to you to give
me the chance.”</p>

<p>First Nathan Wiggin looked astonished, and then slowly his face turned
red.</p>

<p>“Was that whut brought you inter these parts?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That was the principal business. Glover was so hard to handle that I was
delayed until it was only possible for me to get back by train in time for an
important meeting to-night.” Judge Wiggin’s embarrassment was painful.
“Governor,” he said, “circumstances alter cases. I’m ruther sorry circumstances
interfered with that important app’intment of yours. But whinin’ never stopped a
blister from smarting, and it’s too late to dodge after you’ve been jabbed by
the business end of a hornet. Although I’ve said I’d never set foot in one of
them gas-wagon contraptions, considering who’s invited me, if you’ll agree to
proceed circumspect and decorous within the town limits, and promise to land me
back here safe and sound, I’m going to take you up.”</p>

<p>“Done,” accepted Governor Bradley. “Come along, judge.”</p>

<p>Back to Turner’s grocery, where the bigger part of the curious crowds still
hovered around the touring car, they went, the governor walking arm in arm with
Nathan Wiggin, greatly to the wonderment of the staring throng.</p>

<p>“I want you to sit on the forward seat so that you can watch the driver
operate the car, judge,” said the governor, opening one of the forward doors.
“Get in!”</p>

<p>The incredulous and bewildered spectators gasped when the judge complied
without a murmur to this invitation. Lem Dodd had said that Bessie Wiggin had
gone crazy, and now it seemed that Bessie’s father was ready for a padded
cell.</p>

<p>“Wull, what d’ye think o’ that?” mumbled old Abner Nutter, poking his thumb
into the ribs of Joshua Philbrook. “The jedge&mdash;goin’ bubble ridin’ arter
he’s swore a hundred times that there wasn’t money enough in the United States
treasury to hire him to set in one o’ them berjiggered things. I’ve heerd him
say it with my own two ears.”</p>

<p>“They’ve hippynotized him,” was Philbrook’s opinion. “Nothin’ else explains
it. He ain’t in his right mind.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better let Hitchens drive, George,” said the governor,
addressing the injured young man. “I declare, you’re pale! Sure you’re not badly
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Somehow walking makes me dizzy,” was the answer. “Still, I’m feeling better.
I think I’ll step into this store and get a drink of water.”</p>

<p>Having become suddenly anxious, the chief executive followed him into the
store. Hitchens, fretful and none too well pleased with the governor for wasting
so much time on Wiggin, left the latter sitting in the car and mounted the store
steps.</p>

<p>Aware that the accusing eyes of his fellow townsmen were upon him, Nathan
Wiggin gave his attention to the mechanism of the car as displayed before him.
He examined the levers and pedals, squinted at the clock and the speedometer and
the gasoline gauge. He wondered at the numerous contrivances of push buttons and
small levers on the dash. He even bent forward and curiously moved one of the
latter from one side to the other. About that time a bold urchin who had climbed
on the running board released the emergency brake.</p>

<p>It was a cry of warning from somebody in the crowd that made Judge Wiggin
aware that the car was moving. It had been standing on a gentle incline, with
its nose pointing down the long main street, and had started as soon as the
brake was set free.</p>

<p>“Hey!” shouted an excited voice. “She’s goin’! Jump, jedge!”</p>

<p>Nathan Wiggin did not jump. He was not greatly alarmed at first. The thing
had barely started; it was not running away. He had broken and trained vicious
horses that other men could do nothing with, some of them veritable man-killers,
and surely he could stop an inanimate contrivance like a motor car, especially
when it was not under power. Possibly he was restrained also by a conviction
that he could not abandon the car with dignity, and by the knowledge that to
abandon it at all under such circumstances would possibly make him an object of
ridicule. He knew with what keen gusto the Greenbushers “harped on a joke” and
nagged the victim thereof.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” said the judge, moving quickly over into the driver’s seat and
grasping the wheel. “Whoa back!”</p>

<p>The car moved on, those persons who had been in front of it hastily
scrambling out of the way. The judge braced hard with one foot against the
clutch pedal, but that did not seem to have any effect. He grabbed one of the
levers, thinking it might be the brake, and gave it a yank. It was the lever
that manipulated the gears. At the same time his foot slipped off the clutch
pedal.</p>

<p>Thrown into gear, the moving car cranked itself, and the engine leaped to
life with a sudden vibrating hum. For in shifting the tiny lever on the dash
Judge Wiggin had made connections with the magneto. The surprised man gasped as
the machine gave a sudden forward lunge, like a horse beneath the stinging cut
of a whip. Almost before he could gasp twice, the confounded thing was running
away.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” shouted the dismayed man commandingly, surging back on the wheel with
all his strength. “If the bit holds, I’ll break your jaw, you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>One foot was planted on the accelerator, jamming it down and opening the
throttle wide. The engine roared beneath the quivering hood. The car made a jump
that seemed to take all four wheels off the ground. Judge Wiggin’s hat flew off,
his sparse gray hair stood on end, his eyes bulged; but between his parted,
drawn-back lips his teeth were set. Behind him he heard the horrified shouts of
the crowd, through which Hitchens had vainly tried to plow a path in time to
board the machine before it could get beyond his reach. Realizing he had failed,
Hitchens stopped and flung up his arms in despair.</p>

<p>“The old fool!” he groaned. “He’ll smash the car! He’ll be killed!”</p>

</div>

<h2 id='ch_VIII' title="Worse than a Wild Horse.">
  <span>CHAPTER VIII</span><br/>WORSE THAN A WILD HORSE.
</h2>

<p>Annoyed and amazed by the inexplicable and cantankerous behavior of the
automobile, Nathan Wiggin was, at the same time, aroused to resentment and
wrath. The confounded thing was acting exactly like a wild, viciously ugly,
unbroken colt. Immediately the judge’s fighting blood rose. He was stirred by
the tingling joy of contest; it throbbed in every vein of his body. Still
holding the throttle wide open with one foot, he planted the other on the brake,
and sawed at the wheel.</p>

<p>The things the automobile did then made it seem more than ever like a strong
and furious young horse battling against restraint and mastery. It bucked and
plunged in jerky jumps; it “pitched fence-cornered” from side to side, after the
style of a Western broncho; it snorted and choked and snorted again.</p>

<p>“Whoa, you dratted catamaran!” snarled the judge. “You’ve gotter whoa or I’ll
take your jaw off!”</p>

<p>Only for the down grade he might have stalled the engine before the racking
of the car caused his foot to fly off the brake pedal. When that happened, it
continued on its way down the hill toward the wooden bridge that spanned the
Swampscott River, swaying from one side of the road to the other. At times it
threatened to climb trees or telephone poles, or crash through fences and plunge
like a battering-ram into the fronts of houses or stores. But always the crazy
machine swerved in time to avoid disaster, and shot across to the other side of
the road.</p>

<p>When his right hand slipped from the wheel, the judge grabbed the side of the
car body, and his clutching thumb jammed down the button that operated the
electric siren. The button stuck, and the siren howled like a doomed demon of
despair, causing Nathan Wiggin’s hair to stand up stiff as the bristles on a
horse brush.</p>

<p>The fearsome sound of the wailing whistle brought people running to windows
to behold a sight no one in Greenbush had ever expected to see&mdash;Judge
Wiggin driving an automobile! To say that he was driving it more than borders on
hyperbole; it would be far closer to the truth to state that it was driving
him&mdash;frantic! He was not habitually a profane man, but he possessed a broad
vocabulary of vigorous expletives of a more or less impious nature; and it must
be admitted that the language he addressed to that motor car would have shocked
a parson. Those who dashed to their windows in time to see him shoot zigzagging
past beheld a man that was little short of raving mad.</p>

<p>Hens that had been scratching peacefully in the village street fled,
squawking. Barking furiously, a yellow dog charged out. The car leaped at the
animal, struck it with one forward wheel, and sent it, spinning and howling,
into the gutter.</p>

<p>Deaf as a doormat, old Betsy Tucker, going to market with a hand basket
containing two dozen eggs, neither saw nor heard until the runaway auto was
perilously close upon her and the judge was howling like a maniac for her to
“clear the road.” Then she gave a yell and threw up her arms, flinging basket
and eggs into the air. She was saved by sheer luck, for the judge, plunging at
the wheel, turned the machine so that it missed her by less than a foot. The
basket came down, bottom up, on Nathan Wiggin’s head, and the eggs&mdash;well,
for some moments thereafter the judge could not have seen to drive, had he
possessed the required skill. From his shoulders up he resembled the initial
preparation of an omelet.</p>

<p>“Holy sassafras!” he spluttered. “It’s raining fish glue! Everything happens
at once!”</p>

<p>As soon as he could blink a pair of peepholes through that golden
film&mdash;he did not dare let go with his hands to wipe his eyes&mdash;he saw
that the foot of the hill was almost reached, and that the bridge across the
peacefully flowing river lay just ahead. It was not a very wide bridge, and
Tobias Blaisdell, perched on a load of hay drawn by two horses, was just driving
on to the far end.</p>

<p>“Back up, you blinkety-blank jay-hawker!” yelled the judge. “Make a clear
passage or I’ll bore a tunnel in ye!”</p>

<p>Had he been less excited he would have realized that it was much too late for
such a cumbersome obstruction to get out of the way. Blaisdell had time only to
check his horses and stare in horror at the shrieking engine of destruction that
was charging upon him. He did not recognize Nathan Wiggin in the egg-bespattered
wild man who seemed to be guiding the humming mechanism of disaster, but he knew
that, in about four seconds, unless a miracle intervened, horses, motor car,
hay, and human beings were going to be mixed in a spectacular and tragic
smash.</p>

<p>Then, as the uncontrolled automobile reached the middle span of the bridge,
the miracle took place. Shooting suddenly to one side, the machine struck the
wooden railing, and went through it as if it had been constructed of clay
pipestems. Into the deepest part of the river it plunged, flinging up a great
sulash of spray, and disappeared from view. Nathan Wiggin, of Greenbush,
vanished with it.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 id='ch_IX' title="When the Limit Came Off.">
  <span>CHAPTER IX</span><br/>WHEN THE LIMIT CAME OFF.
</h2>

<p>The shouts of the startled crowd in front of Turner’s grocery had brought
those within the store rushing out to learn the cause of alarm. The governor
came with them, followed a second later by the young man who had been tossed by
Libby’s bull. They beheld the motor car well under way, and the judge struggling
frantically and ineffectually to restrain it.</p>

<p>“Great guns!” groaned the governor, turning pale. “Wiggin’s started the
demonstration on his own hook. He’ll smash a four-thousand-dollar car and his
neck at the same time!”</p>

<p>The young man with the bandaged head stiffened. If he felt weak or dizzy at
that moment, he flung it off instantly. With a single bound he was at the foot
of the store steps, against which leaned a bicycle, left there temporarily by
some one. He grabbed the bicycle, uttering a ringing shout for everybody to get
out of the way.</p>

<p>Through the scattered crowd he dashed, leaping to the saddle and catching the
pedals with his nimble feet. Bending over the handlebars, he started in pursuit
of the automobile, which, by this time, was halfway down the hill, with the
wailing siren in full blast.</p>

<p>Continuing to jabber and shout, the crowd followed, stringing out in a
straggling line. Boys and younger men were in the lead. Middle-aged,
bewhiskered, bald-headed men came next. The rear guard was made up of the aged
and decrepit; the very last one of all, bent with rheumatism, and hobbling with
the aid of two canes, being Zebediah Titcomb, the sage of Greenbush.</p>

<p>Never since its foundation had the sleepy town of Greenbush beheld such a
spectacle. Never in its history had there been such tremendous excitement within
its boundaries. The end of all things terrestrial could scarcely have created a
greater hullabaloo in that torpid community.</p>

<p>The young man on the bicycle was not able to overtake the runaway motor car
before it reached the bridge, but he was not far behind it. When the automobile
smashed through the railing and leaped into the river, he jumped from the
bicycle and followed it without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>He was an excellent swimmer, and, rising from the plunge, he saw the head of
Nathan Wiggin bob to the surface within reach of his arm. Immediately he
fastened a hand on the man’s collar.</p>

<p>“Keep still! Stop thrashing,” he said, “and I’ll get you out.”</p>

<p>The somewhat difficult task of rescuing Judge Wiggin from drowning was
accomplished, while the panting throng that had reached the bridge looked on and
cheered. Reaching shallow water, the young man assisted the judge to his feet,
and both waded forth to dry land.</p>

<p>Arriving on shore, the older man immediately sat down facing the river,
beneath the sluggish surface of which Governor Bradley’s automobile lay
immersed. After a few choking gulps, he began to speak in accents and words of
the utmost self-contempt.</p>

<p>“Nate Wiggin,” he said, addressing himself, “you’ve lived to be fifty-four
year old, and arrived at the conclusion that there wasn’t anything that traveled
on legs or wheels that you couldn’t handle. Which goes to show that when a man
thinks he knows all there is to know about anything a shrinkage has set in about
half an inch beneath the roots of his hair. A wise fool is about as safe to have
round as a stick of dynamite bakin’ in the oven of a red-hot stove. If he don’t
damage nobody else, he’s pretty likely to blow up and bust himself.”</p>

<p>The governor and his secretary, followed by a few others, came hurrying to
the spot. Seeing them approach, the judge got upon his feet, dripping tiny
rivulets.</p>

<p>“Governor,” he observed, “there’s no great loss without some small gain.
You’ll save the price of a wash for that there automobile. Whatever damage or
expense may accrue I ca’late I’ll have to sustain. I guess we can find a way to
get her out.”</p>

<p>“I’m thankful,” said Governor Bradley, “that you were not killed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why that should choke you with joy. In your place I’d prob’ly be
so blazin’ mad I’d start in to murder somebody.”</p>

<p>His eyes streaming and his nose snuffling, Weeping Buzzell broke in: “Obadiah
Cobb has come along with his hoss and wagon. He’s right there at the end of the
bridge, and he’ll take ye home, jedge. You better git outer them wet clothes it
you don’t want to ketch your everlarsting.”</p>

<p>“I’m no wetter’n this young feller who yanked me outer the drink,” said the
judge. “He’s got to come along to the house with me and get fixed up. And you,
too, governor, and t’other gentleman&mdash;you come; I insist on it. You’re
going to stop with me, the whole caboodle of ye, to supper. Hosspitality
deferred may be hosspitality soured, but I’ll guarantee to do my best to sweeten
it up on this occasion.”</p>

<p>By this time it seemed that by far the greater portion of the inhabitants of
the town were packed upon the bridge or jamming the roadway. And when Obadiah
Cobb took the governor, the judge, and the other two men into his double seater
and started back up the hill with them, the crowd laughed and cheered again.</p>

<p>“Governor,” said Judge Wiggin, “I dunno whether that’s meant for you or for
the young man who hauled me out of the stream, but either way it’s proper well
deserved. If you hadn’t been dead game, you’d have kicked like a steer over
what’s happened, and if he wasn’t good grit to the bone he’d never have gone
into the river arter me. Which is admittin’ I made a mistake in sizing him up
when I found my darter making a touse over him.”</p>

<p>Among the few villagers who remained unaware of the recent lively events were
Judge Wiggin’s sister and his daughter. Of course they were thrown into a great
flutter. Miss Sally said: “My stars!” What Miss Bessie said was whispered into
the ear of the water-soaked but smiling young man, who gave her a look and a sly
squeeze of the hand that brought a rosy flush to her cheeks.</p>

<p>Dry clothes were found; also “a little nip of something to parry off chills.”
Warming up, the participants in the adventure joked and laughed, even though the
judge seemed to have something on his mind that was giving him some serious
thought. What this was appeared later after they had partaken of a genuine
old-fashioned New England supper, topped off with doughnuts and hot apple pie
and steaming, fragrant coffee.</p>

<p>Turning his eyes to the governor, who sat at the right of Miss Sally, Nathan
Wiggin said: “Governor, putting aside the question of damages I owe on account
of what happened to your automobile, ca’late it’s up to me to express my
appreciation of whut you done to induce Ephraim Glover to take back and give me
a clear field. With a clear start, I reckon I can carry this deestrict, and help
you to carry the county. Anyhow, I’m going to lay myself out to do it.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good to me,” laughed the governor.</p>

<p>“Furthermore,” pursued the host, “I’ve decided to abolish the trapping of
automobile drivers in this here town. Mebbe,” he admitted, “this may appear a
leetle dite selfish on my part as, havin’ got my dander up by the pranks played
on me by that there gas go-cart of yourn, governor, I’m contemplating buying one
myself and running the consarned cantraption until I git it tamed. If there was
traps hereabouts, mebbe I’d git took up and have to fine myself for busting the
speed limit. Therefore, henceforth there ain’t going to be no speed limit in
Greenbush.”</p>

<p>Beneath the edge of the table, old Shep, attempting to lick Bessie’s hand
with his tongue, licked also the hand of the young man who sat beside her. And
before sitting down, the young people had found an opportunity, quite
unobserved, to exchange a few words in private. Somehow neither of them had
evinced any great desire for food, but while George was still unnaturally pale,
the roses continued to bloom in Bessie’s cheeks.</p>

<p>Now George spoke up boldly: “As long as you have abolished the speed limit,
Judge Wiggin, I am going to improve the occasion to ask you for your daughter’s
hand in marriage. Doubtless it will seem rather hasty to you, but everything has
moved with a rush this afternoon. I have put the question to Bessie, and won her
consent.”</p>

<p>The governor stared. Miss Nancy nearly fainted. Bessie Wiggin trembled
visibly. Nathan P. Wiggin gazed hard at the young man for about thirty seconds,
and then scratched his chin, a queer pucker screwing up his face.</p>

<p>“Wull, I declare!” said the judge at last. “That is going some! Never quite
reckoned on my darter hookin’ up with a shuffer, but, having saved me from
drownding, you’ve took me at a disadvantage. If Bessie has said yes, and you kin
furnish the proper creedenshuls I’ll have to take your proposition under
consideration, I guess.”</p>

<p>The governor looked Bessie Wiggin over appraisingly, and decided that he had
made no mistake in thinking her an unusually pretty and charming young lady.</p>

<p>“It is sudden,” he said, laughing softly, “and it would not have happened if
George had not offered to drive for me to-day, my regular chauffeur being ill.
In the way of credentials, judge, let me state that he is my son.”</p>

<p>The judge’s sister sat bolt upright in a jiffy. The judge coughed behind his
hand, the pucker crinkling the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Them creedenshuls, governor,” he stated, “are wholly satisfactory to me.”
His whole body seemed to shake oddly. “I’m afraid I’m going to have a chill,
after all,” he added. “I think the governor and me had better take a little walk
in the moonlight.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
